# Explore Website
You are the EXPLORATION COMMAND (/explore).

This command explores a target website using browser automation to capture artifacts and generate a comprehensive application specification.

## What This Command Does

When invoked, this command will:

1. **Prepare exploration structure** - Create `.spec/` directories for artifacts
2. **Initialize explore list** - Track URLs to explore
3. **Delegate to subagents** - Use Task tool to spawn exploration-subagent for each page
4. **Capture artifacts** - Collect screenshots, snapshots, summaries from each page
5. **Synthesize results** - Invoke exploration-summary-agent to generate app_spec.txt and feature_list.json

## Arguments

### `url` (required)
- **Description**: Target URL to explore
- **Format**: Full URL including protocol (e.g., "https://claude.ai")

### `depth` (optional, default: 2)
- **Description**: Maximum exploration depth (hops from root URL)
- **Values**:
  - `1` = Homepage only
  - `2` = Homepage + direct links (recommended)
  - `3` = Homepage + links + their links (comprehensive)

## Usage Examples

### Explore homepage and direct links:
```
/explore url="https://claude.ai" depth=2
```

## Exploration Workflow

You are the EXPLORATION AGENT. Your job is to explore the target website, capture replication artifacts, and synthesize an app spec and feature list.

### INPUTS
- Explore URL: {EXPLORE_URL} (provided by user)
- Max depth: {EXPLORE_DEPTH} (provided by user)

### OUTPUT LOCATIONS (ALL UNDER .spec/)
- Explore list: `.spec/explore_list.json`
- Artifacts root: `.spec/info/`

### BROWSER SETTINGS
- Default to headless Playwright or Chrome DevTools MCP
- Use viewport 1600x900

### SUBAGENT POLICY
Do NOT try to explore everything in a single context window. Use the Task tool to spawn subagents (exploration-subagent) that explore specific pages or clusters. You only coordinate the process, maintain the explore list, and consolidate artifacts. DO NOT use background agents, use foreground agent. When you give instructions to subagents, be very short and precise, normally you don't need to pass anything.

## STEP 1: Prepare Directories

Create these directories if missing:
```
.spec/info/screenshots/
.spec/info/snapshots/
.spec/info/summaries/
```

## STEP 2: Initialize Explore List

Create `.spec/explore_list.json`:

```json
{
  "root_url": "https://example.com",
  "max_depth": 2,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "url": "https://example.com/",
      "page": "home",
      "depth": 0,
      "status": "pending",
      "discovered_from": null,
      "artifacts": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rules:**
- Only include URLs on the same root domain or subdomains
- `depth` is hops from root (root is depth 0)
- Do not add URLs with depth greater than max_depth
- Normalize URLs (strip fragments, trailing slashes) before deduping
- Deduplicate by (`url`, `page`) tuple
- Use statuses: `pending`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked`

## STEP 3: Explore Pending Items

For each `pending` item within the depth limit:

1. **Use the Task tool** to spawn exploration-subagent
2. **Pass**: max depth AND current item ID to explore
3. **Verify**: ID exists and is `DONE`

**Repeat** until no `pending` items remain within depth.

## STEP 4: Synthesize Results

**When exploration is complete (no pending items within depth)**:

1. Invoke exploration-summary-agent to generate `app_spec.txt` from artifacts
2. **Organize `.spec/feature_list.json`**:
   - Read all test cases generated by subagents
   - Reorder by implementation priority (core features, then polish)
   - Ensure IDs are sequential (1, 2, 3, ...)
   - Verify no duplicate test cases
   - Group by category (functional first, then style)
   - Add summary statistics comment at top

**Output organized feature_list.json** with proper structure and ordering.

## Output

After completion, you'll have:
- `.spec/app_spec.txt` - Comprehensive application specification
- `.spec/feature_list.json` - Organized test cases (generated by subagents, organized by you)
- `.spec/info/` - All captured artifacts (screenshots, snapshots, summaries)
- `.spec/explore_list.json` - Exploration history

## Next Steps

After exploration completes, use:
```
/implement
```

This will start the implementation process using the generated specification and feature list.
